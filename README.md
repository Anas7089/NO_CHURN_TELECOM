# NO_CHURN_TELECOM
🚀 Excited to share my latest Data Science project with No-Churn Telecom! 📊

In this project, I helped No-Churn, a European telecom operator, tackle the challenge of customer churn using Machine Learning. With the market becoming increasingly competitive, retaining customers has become more critical than ever. Here's how we approached the problem:

🔍 Key Objectives:

Understanding Variables: Analyzed key factors influencing customer migration.
Churn Risk Scoring: Created risk scores to drive targeted retention campaigns.
CHURN-FLAG Prediction: Developed a binary predictor to identify at-risk customers for focused email campaigns.
I deployed the solution using Streamlit, and the project is now live. 💡

This project highlights the power of data in solving real-world business challenges. Feel free to check it out and reach out if you'd like to learn more!
